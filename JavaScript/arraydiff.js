// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, whch subtracts one list from another and returns the result. 

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order. 
// creat a function that takes two arrays as arguments
    // iterate through the first array
        // check if values of a are present in values of b
        // if values are present in list a, and list b, remove values from list a
